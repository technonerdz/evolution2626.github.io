    <h5>Summer Camps</h5>
    <p>Since the summer of 2011, Team 2626 is hosting an annual robotics camp at the SÃ©minaire de Sherbrooke. This camp gives the opportunity to young students aged from 10 to 14 to take on several challenges with NXT Mindstorm Lego sets. Our popular student & alumni-powered summer camp brings the love of STEM and the values of FIRST into the lives of hundreds of eager students. We set them challenges, and they learn Gracious Professionalism by competing with themselves and others in a respectful, positive, dynamic manner. They reach new heights through teamwork and collaboration, and rebound from failures to overcome difficulties through Coopertition.</p>
    <p>In Summer 2016, Evolution 2626 offered an 8-week long program. We speak, teach and inspire in both French and English!</p>
